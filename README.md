Technology:
Pycharm
Python - PyGame and Random Modules

Elements:
Sound - atmospheric music developed from scratch (.ogg and .wav)

Aesthetics:
Music Tempo gives anticipation
Make move faster by long press down to vary stress
Challenge/Strategy:
Trying to make blocks fall like lava to fill rows

Economy:
Resource: Time Points

Teamwork
- Preproduction Design
  - Ideation -  google doc with functionality to be implemented
  - Prototype: Tetris Game in Python
- Expectations - fun reverse tetris game with quirky cool features

Constraints
- Time:
  Team Availability
  - productivity hours were variable
- Game Functionality:
  - Win not explicitly defined
  - Quit not implemented
  - Flow and instructions not narrated
